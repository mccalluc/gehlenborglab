# Releasing the Web Design Standards

This is our official process for releasing new versions of the [U.S. Web Design
Standards](https://standards.usa.gov).

## Principles
1. Follow well-established [versioning practices](#versioning)
1. Provide detailed notes for each [release](#what-is-a-release)
1. Encourage contributions and thank contributors for their hard work


## Versioning
[Semantic versioning][semver] is a method of numbering release versions that
aims to help users understand the implications of upgrading from one
[release](#what-is-a-release) to another. Semantic version numbers take the
form `major.minor.patch`, where:

* Bug fixes increment the `patch` number (e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`)
* New features increment the `minor` number and reset `patch` (e.g. `1.0.1` to
  `1.1.0`)
* Changes to the [public API](#public-api) (breaking changes) increment the
  `major` version and reset `minor` and `patch` (e.g. `1.1.2` to `2.0.0`)

### What is a release?
Technically, release of the Web Design Standards core code "lives" in two
different places:

1. On GitHub as a [tag][git tag] and corresponding [release][releases]
1. On [npm][what is npm] as a release of the [`uswds` package][uswds on npm] with the same version number as the GitHub release

### The public API
In most software projects, the "public API" corresponds to a single set of
programming constructs, such as public classes or functions.  Because the
Standards consist of tightly-bound HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we must consider
any "breaking" change to _any_ of these as a change to the public API. For
example, any of the following should trigger a major version increment:

* Changing the name of any `.usa-` class name (documented or not)
* Changing the way in which elements with `.usa-` class names are structured in
  HTML
* Changing the HTML "API" for any of our interactive components, such as the
  [accordion](https://standards.usa.gov/accordions/)


## Release process

### Git workflow

* We have two main branches that are never deleted:
  * `master` always points to the latest release
  * `develop` contains changes being prepped for a release

* When introducing a change (feature, bug fix, etc.):

  1. Branch off `develop`:
  
      ```sh
      git fetch origin
      git checkout -b feature-foo origin/develop
      ```
      
  1. As a naming convention, your branch name can be anything except `master`,
     `develop`, or with the `release-` or `hotfix-` prefix

  1. Changes are merged back into the `develop` branch
  
* When publishing a new release:

  1. Branch off `develop` and use the branch name format `release-{version}`,
     e.g.

      ```sh
      git fetch origin
      git checkout -b release-1.0.0 origin/develop
      ```

  1. Run [`npm version`][npm version] with `--no-tag` to increment the version
     number semantically. (Versions are tagged on the `master` branch.)
     
    * For minor and major versions, publish a pre-release:
  
      ```sh
      npm version prerelease --no-tag
      ```
      
    * Otherwise, run either `npm version minor --no-tag` or `npm version major
      --no-tag`

    * In either case, [`npm version`][npm version] will increment the version
      number in `package.json` and commit the changes to git.

  1. Open a [pull request] from your `release-` branch to merge into `master`.
     List the key changes for a release in the pull request description. (The
     diff will show you exactly what has changed since the previous release.)
     See [the v1.0.0 pull request](#TODO) for an example.

  1. Tag the release on the `master` branch **or** create the tag when you
     draft the release notes.

  1. Merge the release commits back into `develop` from `master` with a [pull
     request].

  1. Write the release notes on GitHub:

    1. [Draft the release][draft release] from the corresponding tag on the
       `master` branch.

    1. Have at least one team member review the release notes.

    1. Publish the [release](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases)
       on GitHub.

  1. Update the docs site with the new version number and release notes:

    1. Update the `uswds` Node dependency to the new version, e.g.:

      ```sh
      cd path/to/web-design-standards-docs
      export VERSION=1.0.0
      git fetch origin
      git checkout -b release-${VERSION} origin/develop
      npm install --save-dev uswds@${VERSION}
      ```

    1. Update the `version` [variable in
       _config.yml](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/blob/master/_config.yml#L3).

    1. Follow the above release process to merge the changes to `master` via a
       [pull request on the docs repo](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/compare),
       minus the GitHub release notes.
