<h3 id="postdoctoral-fellows">Postdoctoral Fellows</h3>

<p>Multiple postdoctoral fellowships are available immediately in the Gehlenborg Lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>The goal of the lab is to improve human health by developing computational techniques and interfaces that enable biomedical and clinical investigators to efficiently interact with biomedical data. We design, implement and evaluate methods and tools that leverage the knowledge and cognitive skills of investigators in order to enable the interpretation of massive heterogeneous data sets that integrate genomic and clinical data.</p>

<p>Possible research projects include development of data visualization, analysis, and management tools to study genomic structural variants, dynamics of the 3D genome, and cancer subtypes in patient cohorts. Further projects involve the design and implementation of visual exploration tools for biomedical data repositories and tools for viewing and interacting with provenance graphs. All of the projects are highly interdisciplinary and are being conducted in close cooperation with computational or experimental domain experts providing an excellent opportunity for collaborative research.</p>

<p>Our lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics is part of a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge. The Department has recently been formed at Harvard Medical School to lead development of computational and informatics techniques to address pertinent challenges in modern biological sciences and medicine. The Departmentâ€™s faculty conduct research at the intersection of biomedicine and information sciences, including bioinformatics, functional genomics, translational medicine, and clinical knowledge management. Based on the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, it provides a rich scientific environment, with many seminar series and invited speakers of the highest caliber.</p>

<h4 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h4>
<p>The postdoctoral fellows will be responsible for developing novel methodologies and applications to facilitate visual analysis of massive heterogeneous biomedical data sets, including genomic and clinical data. While the focus of the positions is on the development of visualization approaches, the roles will also involve the integration of such tools with data analysis and data management tools.</p>

<p>Other responsibilities include day-to-day project management, including coordination with collaborators and other team members, as well as the writing of manuscripts. Contribution to the grant writing efforts of the lab are expected.</p>

<h4 id="basic-requirements">Basic Requirements</h4>
<p>Candidates must have a PhD degree in a quantitative field such as bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical informatics, medical informatics, computer science or related fields and a track-record of publication in the top journals or conferences of their field. Hands-on experience with management, analysis, and visualization of biomedical data as well as experience in developing (web-based) interactive software tools are required for this position. Excellent programming skills and working knowledge of state-of-the-art software development techniques are essential. The candidates interested in these positions must be highly motivated, willing to learn and demonstrate initiative in assigned tasks. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are crucial.</p>

<h4 id="additional-requirements">Additional Requirements</h4>
<p>Experience with Python, JavaScript, web application development and cloud computing are desirable. Previous research experience in areas such as epigenomics or cancer genomics will be beneficial.</p>

<h4 id="terms">Terms</h4>
<p>The positions are available immediately and can be renewed annually.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h4>
<p>Candidates should submit their CV, a research statement, PDFs of their three best papers, and contact information for three references to nils@hms.harvard.edu with [POSTDOC] in the subject.</p>

<p>Harvard Medical School is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
