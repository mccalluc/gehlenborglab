tagline: Data visualization driving biomedical discovery.
intro: |
  The Gehlenborg Lab at Harvard Medical School is a group of data scientists and software developers who are passionate about driving biomedical discovery by creating efficient and effective visual interfaces between analysts and data. We focus on the development of visual analysis tools for genomic and other biomedical data to address challenges in basic and clinical research.

  Our methodological approaches include exploratory data visualization, knowledge representation. We are particularly interested in applying our approaches in cancer genomics, epigenomics, and chromosome conformation studies.
